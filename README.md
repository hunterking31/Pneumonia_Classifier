# Pneumonia_Classifier
This is a Pneumonia (both Bacterial and Virus) classifier model built using Keras fine-tuning the VGG16 architect with the imagenet weights. Viewers are requested to download the pneumonia dataset from Kaggle website. Rename and copy all the train,test and validation files of normal, virus and bacteria into a seperate folders and use it as a base directory for the dataset. I did this for simplification purpose and easy understanding of newbies like me.
